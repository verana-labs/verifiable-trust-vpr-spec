# Verifiable Public Registry Specification (VPR Spec)

## About

The Verifiable Public Registry Specification describes a decentralized infrastructure — a “registry of trust registries” — used to manage digital trust at scale.

It provides:

- **Trust Registries**: Lists of authorized entities who can issue or verify specific credentials within an Ecosystem.
- **Credential Schema Management**: Defining credential types, their governance, and permissions (who can issue/verify them).
- **Validation Process**: Transparent procedures to authorize issuers, verifiers, and grantors.
- **Tokenized Trust Model**: A mechanism using tokens to reward trustworthy participants, ensure accountability, and prevent misuse.
- **DID Directory**: A public listing of DIDs to help discovery and indexing of trusted services.

Its goal is to support open, transparent governance of trust ecosystems and enable global, decentralized identity management.
