# verifiable-trust-vpr-spec

## About

Draft specification for a Verifiable Public Registry (VPR), a decentralized, ledger-based system designed to improve internet security and trust. The VPR manages trust registries, credential schemas, and permissions for issuing and verifying credentials. It uses a tokenized business model to incentivize participation and maintain the system. The specification details the data model, module requirements, and various methods for managing trust registries, credential schemas, permissions, validation processes, and a DID directory. A governance framework ensures adherence to established rules.
